Batchfile Framework (BFW)

The Batchfile Framework (BFW) is a comprehensive suite designed to simplify and standardize the development of batch files for Windows. By providing a structured approach to script creation, BFW aims to enhance readability, maintainability, and reusability of batch scripts across various projects and applications.
Features

Features

    Function Library: A rich set of pre-defined functions covering a wide range of common scripting tasks, from file manipulation to network operations.
    Array Simulation: Utilizes a convention-based approach to mimic array structures, enabling complex data handling and manipulation.
    Enhanced Error Handling: Offers robust error detection and handling mechanisms to improve script reliability.
    Modular Design: Encourages modular scripting with support for including external batch files, facilitating code reuse and organization.
    Consistent Coding Style: Comes with a detailed style guide to promote coding consistency and best practices among batch file developers.
    Help Functionality: Each script function includes a -help option, providing users with usage information and examples directly from the command line.
    Array and Variable Management: Guidelines for effective management of variables and simulated arrays, ensuring efficient data storage and access.

### Getting Started

## Prerequisites

BFW requires no additional software installations and runs on any Windows version supporting batch scripting (Windows XP and later).

## Installation

# 1. Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BatchfileFramework.git

# 2. Include BFW in your batch file:

At the beginning of your batch file, add:

    call path\to\BatchfileFramework\bfw_init.bat

This command initializes the framework and makes all BFW functions available in your script.

## Usage

To use a function from the framework, simply call it by its name following the BFW conventions. For example, to call a function named exampleFunction:

    call :exampleFunction param1 param2

For detailed information on using specific functions, including parameters and examples, use the -help option:

    call :exampleFunction-help
