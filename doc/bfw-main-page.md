## Quick Start

BFW aims to standardize batch file scripting, providing a common structure and set of practices for writing, documenting, and using batch scripts. Whether you're creating simple utility scripts or complex automation workflows, BFW offers the tools and conventions to make your scripts more reliable and easier to use.

### Key Features

-   **Structured Function Calls**: Dynamically call functions based on the script name, simplifying script organization and execution.
-   **Pseudo-Array Handling**: Simulate array structures for effective data manipulation.
-   **Comprehensive Documentation**: Use function cards and help functions to thoroughly document script capabilities and usage.
-   **Best Practices**: Adhere to a consistent coding style and best practices for script maintenance and readability.

### Getting Started

To start using BFW in your projects, clone the framework from its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/batchfileframework/BatchfileFrameWork) and explore the documentation to familiarize yourself with its conventions and capabilities. Begin by structuring your batch scripts according to the BFW guidelines, leveraging the framework's approach to function design, argument handling, and documentation.
